    Class methods
    -------------
    INPUT_TYPES (dict):
        Tell the main program input parameters of nodes.
    IS_CHANGED:
        optional method to control when the node is re executed.

    Attributes
    ----------
    RETURN_TYPES (`tuple`):
        The type of each element in the output tulple.
    RETURN_NAMES (`tuple`):
        Optional: The name of each output in the output tulple.
    FUNCTION (`str`):
        The name of the entry-point method. For example, if `FUNCTION = "execute"` then it will run Example().execute()
    OUTPUT_NODE ([`bool`]):
        If this node is an output node that outputs a result/image from the graph. The SaveImage node is an example.
        The backend iterates on these output nodes and tries to execute all their parents if their parent graph is properly connected.
        Assumed to be False if not present.
    CATEGORY (`str`):
        The category the node should appear in the UI.
    execute(s) -> tuple || None:
        The entry point method. The name of this method must be the same as the value of property `FUNCTION`.
        For example, if `FUNCTION = "execute"` then this method's name must be `execute`, if `FUNCTION = "foo"` then it must be `foo`.

        The node will always be re executed if any of the inputs change but
        this method can be used to force the node to execute again even when the inputs don't change.
        You can make this node return a number or a string. This value will be compared to the one returned the last time the node was
        executed, if it is different the node will be executed again.
